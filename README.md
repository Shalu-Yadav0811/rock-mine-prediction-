Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

Overview
This project is a binary classification model that predicts whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signals. The dataset used for training contains numerical features extracted from sonar waves.

Dataset 
Dataset Name: Sonar Dataset
Features: 60 numerical attributes representing sonar signal frequencies
Source: [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks))  

Target Labels :
R → Rock
M → Mine

Technologies Used :
- Python 
- Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Google Colab
